### Cloning


```bash
git clone https://github.com/e-dddos/bussysteme_projekt.git
```

### Workflow

- Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
- Commit your changes (You can use VSCode or Github Desktop for an easier way to commit)
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/my-feature`)
- Create a Pull Request
- Ask somebody (preferably a team member) to review your code
- Wait for the reviewer to approve your PR (or ask for changes)
- Merge your PR

### Avoiding conflicts

- Make sure to keep each branch concise and focused on a single feature or bugfix
- Avoid working on multiple projects at the same time
- Merge changes from the main branch into your feature branch regularly (`git pull origin main`)
- Communicate with your team members about what you are working on
